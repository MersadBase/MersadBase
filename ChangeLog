1-say system was rolled back to the older version. the newer system was more like agent2d say system which didn't use the 10 characters optimized.
2-added space character to valid chars in say system which was forgotten 73 -> 74
3-say system changed fundamentally now we have CodeItem, CodeItemInt,CodeItemFloat,CodeItemPoint which we can use to code and decode params.a new structure named SayHearVars is used to initialize the variables we want to say and their value ranges and precision.this helps us to code less in coding & decoding and mathematical procedures are done automatically.(man avalesh mikhastam too worldModelHear dige moteghayer tarif nakonam va daghighan har chi invar code shod oonvar decode beshe va faghat az hamoon SayHearVars estefade beshe ke ta ye haddi ham shodani bood vali dar kol az lahaz sakhtari dorost nabood va jaleb nemishod age ye moteghayeri faghat gharar bood mohasebe beshe va oon var say nemishod vase hamin dobare oon moteghayer haye sabeghe heardX ro tarif kardam :( dar kol bad nashod vali mitoonest behtar beshe)
